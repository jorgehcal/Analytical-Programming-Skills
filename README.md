# Analytical-Programming-Skills
In this repository I provide two humble examples of two distinct tasks, one in R and the other in Python, both of them being modified parts of the bigger project that I am currently working on. These two tasks are similar in the sense that they are related to data science problems. I briefly explain in what consists each of them:

   - FilterQuestion.R is an R file where I explain in a simple way the problem of 
     recuperating ommited information in dataframes which born from surveys.
     
   - Data_Processing&Graphic.py is a Python file where I show how to process the file YourData.xls
     to obtain the interactive file Health_Age_Sex.html.
     
Thank you very much for your attention,

Jorge
