# Analytical-Programming-Skills
In this repository I provide two humble examples of two distinct tasks, one in R and the other in Python, both of them being modified parts of the bigger project that I am currently working on. These two tasks are similar in the sense that they are related to data science problems. I briefly explain each of them:

   - FilterQuestion.R is an R file where I explain in a simple way the problem of 
     recuperating ommited information in dataframes which born from surveys
     
   - Creating an Interactive Graphic with Altair.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file where I show how to process the file YourData.xls
     with Python code to obtain an interactive bar graphic (you may see a photo of it in the repository: Graphic_Healt_Age_Sex.png). The file Data_Processing_&Graphic.py  
     is merely the code corresponding to the Jupyter Notebook, just in case you would like to have it. If you compile it in your computer, you may play with the html file which
     it generates.
      
As an extra document, I have added the following pdf about another data problem:

  - ClusteringBigML.pdf shows an application of a basic algorithm in Machine Learning, the K-means algorithm, using the online software BigMl, which I have recently learnt to       use.

I would like to highlight that I am not a Python, nor an R nor a Machine Learning expert. With these files my aim is to show you my ability to learn different programming languages, and to pose and solve new and different problems with several resources.

Thank you very much for your attention,

Jorge
