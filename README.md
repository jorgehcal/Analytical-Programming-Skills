# Analytical-Programming-Skills
In this repository I provide two humble examples of two distinct tasks, one in R and the other in Python. These two tasks are similar in the sense that they are related with data science problems. I briefly explain in what consists each of them:

   - FilterQuestion.R is an R file where I explain in a simple way the problem of 
     recuperating ommited information in dataframes which born from surveys.
     
   - Data_Processing&Graphic.py is a Python file where I show how to process the file YourData.xls
     to obtain the interactive file Health_Age_Sex.html. The mentioned files are also in
     this repository.
     
Thank you very much for your attention,
Jorge
